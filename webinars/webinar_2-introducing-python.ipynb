    "This is a very short program, which creates a variable (`shopping`) that refers to a list and then prints out each of the items in turn.  There are a couple of things to comment on here.  Firstly, the `for` statement creates the variable `item` (the variable name can be anything that you want), then sets the value to each of the elements in the list.  The line that is indented is then executed for each value assigned to the `item` variable, printing out this value.

    "Whenever we want to execute a bit of Python code several times, a **for loop** is one of the ways that we can do it.  Python recognises the lines we want to form part of the loop by the level of indentation and it is vital that you maintain consistent indentation throughout your programs. For example, you can choose to indent lines of code with spaces or with tabs but, whichever one you choose, you should only use one or the other for your whole program. Also, make sure that you keep the amount of indentation consistent across all the levels in your code. You will find that this approach makes your programs easier to read and understand, because you can see the structure of the program at a glance by the indentation."

This mainly happens when you havenâ€™t closed a set of brackets, which in the above example was deliberate, but in my case is usually because I have forgotten.
