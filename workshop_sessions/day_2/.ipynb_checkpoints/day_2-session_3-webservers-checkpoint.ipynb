    "\n",
    "* **API**: An **Application Program Interface** is a way to interact with a resource, database, or application programatically (as opposed to a grafical interface).\n",
    "* **Web Service**: An **API** which recieves requests and returns results over the web, typically using HTTP.\n",
    "* **REST API**: A **REpresentational State Transfer API** is a **Web API** which adheres to the **REST** guidelines: A set of guidelines which specify how the the **Web API** receives queries and returns results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many resources which call temselves RESTful are not 100% compliant, and many non-REST Web API's implement some RESTful guidelines. Some people refer to REST-like interfaces. In this Notebook we will not be making a large distinction between these, and will refer to broadly as **Web Services**."
